# find-near-Earth-objects

With this application, one can search for all near-Earth objects (NEO) on any specific day. Simply enter the date you wish see, and then a list of all NEO on that day will be listed.

This uses the NeoWs ([Near Earth Object Web Service](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#NeoWS)) API to retrieve the data.

Bugs that still need fixing:
- [] JPL links don't work on mobile.

Features to be added:
- [] Fade when a new date is submitted
- [] Either a 2D or 3D visual display which shows the distance of the objects at their closest.
